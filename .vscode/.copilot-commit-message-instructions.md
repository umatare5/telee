# Commit Message Instructions

- **Use Conventional Commits:** Use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format for commit messages to ensure clarity and consistency in the commit history.

- **Meaningful Commits:** Split files into meaningful units when committing. Group related changes together and commit them as logical units rather than committing all changes at once.

- **Respect .gitignore:** Always respect `.gitignore` rules when committing. Do not include ignored files such as `.copilot_reports/`, temporary files, or build artifacts in commits.

## Examples

- `feat/api: Implement new method to fetch access point data`
- `fix/client: correctly handle 404 responses as errors`
- `refactor/vlans: extract vlan validation logic into a helper`
- `docs/readme: update usage examples`
- `feat/api!: Remove legacy methods compatible with legacy clients`
